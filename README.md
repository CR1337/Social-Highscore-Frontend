# Social-Highscore-Frontend

This project is part of the course 'Design and construction of AI-based interactive
systems with a "dark side of AI"' at the Chair of [Computer Graphics Systems](https://hpi.de/en/research/research-groups/computer-graphics-systems.html) at the Hasso Plattner Institute.

It is a prototype of a dystopian mobile game set in a fictional totalitarian state. The player is regularly forced to disguise his outwardly displayed emotions. This is monitored by regular scans of the face via the smartphone camera.

In the [backend](https://github.com/CR1337/Social-Highscore-Backend/tree/main) we use [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)  for emotion analysis.
